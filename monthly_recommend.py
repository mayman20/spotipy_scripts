Script Name: top_monthly_recommendation.py
Author: Assistant
Date: 2025‑08‑02

Purpose
-------
This script uses the Spotipy library to build a personalised Spotify playlist for
the authenticated user.  It performs the following steps:

1. Authenticate the user via Spotify's Authorization Code flow.
2. Fetch the user's top 50 tracks over the last four weeks using the
   `current_user_top_tracks` endpoint.  Spotify's Web API documentation notes
   that the `time_range` parameter accepts `short_term` for approximately the
   last four weeks and allows a maximum of 50 items per request【107126540958127†L290-L351】.
3. For each of those top tracks, request a single recommended track using the
   `/recommendations` endpoint with the top track as the seed.  According to
   Spotify, recommendations can be generated using up to five seeds (artists,
   tracks or genres), and the number of tracks returned is controlled by the
   `limit` parameter【405106581519715†L304-L347】.  Here we supply only one track ID
   per request and set `limit=1` to get exactly one recommendation per seed.
4. Deduplicate any recommended tracks that might repeat across seeds or that
   appear in the user's original top tracks.
5. Create (or optionally find) a playlist named ``Top Monthly Recommendation``
   under the current user's account.  Playlists are created via the
   `user_playlist_create` endpoint; by default new playlists are public, but you
   can specify `public=False` to make them private【303264597445994†L356-L365】.
6. Populate the playlist with the list of recommended tracks.  The
   `playlist_add_items` endpoint allows adding up to 100 items per request,
   which comfortably covers the 50 recommendations.

Usage
-----
1. Install the Spotipy package (if you haven't already) and ensure network
   connectivity:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install spotipy

2. Register a Spotify application at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
   and note your client ID, client secret and redirect URI.  Add the redirect
   URI to your application's settings.

3. Set the following environment variables before running the script so
   Spotipy can pick up your credentials automatically:

   .. code-block:: bash

       export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="your‑client‑id"
       export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="your‑client‑secret"
       export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI="your‑redirect‑uri"

4. Run the script:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python top_monthly_recommendation.py

   On the first run, Spotipy will open a web browser for you to authenticate
   with your Spotify account and grant the required scopes.  Once authorised,
   an access token will be cached in ``.cache``, so subsequent runs won't need
   to re‑authenticate unless the token expires or the scopes change.

Dependencies
------------
* spotipy >= 2.22 (a lightweight Python wrapper for the Spotify Web API)
* python-dotenv (optional, if you prefer to load credentials from a ``.env`` file)

Required Scopes
---------------
The script requests the following OAuth scopes:

* ``user-top-read`` – required for reading the user's top tracks over a
  specified time range【107126540958127†L290-L351】.
* ``playlist-modify-private`` and ``playlist-modify-public`` – required for
  creating and editing playlists【303264597445994†L356-L365】.

If you set ``public=False`` when creating the playlist, your user must have
authorised ``playlist-modify-private``; if you leave the playlist public, you
need ``playlist-modify-public``.
